<p class='aboutUs'>Our team here at Scarce Coin Curations takes pride in providing investors with the most comprehensive
  list of crypto
  currencies with a low circulating supply. In the near future we look to include updates on other 'scassets',
  such as NFT's, giving users an even greater oppurtunity to build wealth! </p>

  <h1 class='aboutUs' , class="aboutUsHeaders">Scarcity Score
  </h1>
  <p2 class='aboutUs'>Our scarcity score is a represenation of a coin's circulating supply relative to other currencies
    on the market.
    The SS range spands from 1 to 5, with one being the least scarce and 5 being the most scarce. While pretty
    straight forward, our scaricty score provides investors with a simple solution to understanding supply
    metrics.
